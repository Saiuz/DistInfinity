# Distributed Infinity

Distributed Infinity is dapp used to loan any item to people you may not even know, and track it (and your profits) on the Ethereum blockchain. 

## Use Case

The inital use case is a distributed library for childerens' books in Ukrainian. Business case: buying and shipping books in Ukrainian is expensive. Solution: enable the local community of parents to exchange books during playgroups and other events. 

## Approach

A book owner establishes a contract with a borrower. The borrower puts up a collateral and a fee for borrowing a book for a set period of time. The borrow can then return the book and get the collateral back, or transfer the responsibility for the book to another parent. When this transaction takes place, the original borrower gets their collateral back, plus get paid finder's fee. The new borrower assumes the responsibility for the book by putting up the collateral and paying two fees: the borrower's fee to the book owner and the finder's fee. The cycle continues until the book is returned to the owner (and collateral is paid back to the last borrower) or there is an exception in the contract and the collateral is paid to the book owner.
